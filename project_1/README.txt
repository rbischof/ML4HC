The datasets are stored in the folder "data".
ML4HC_Project_1.pdf is our report.
The folder "models" contains a vast number of trained models that we compared against each other.
If you train your own model in Analysis.ipynb, a new folder will be created within "models" with the name of your new model.
All python scripts ending with "_arch.py" are the base models we created. They are modular and accept parameters for finetuning the network.
Use Analysis.ipynb to reproduce our results.
